# RAPID API Quota Issue - Fixed! ✅

## Problem Identified
You were experiencing "No output" when running code in the code editor because the RAPID API (Judge0) daily quota was exceeded.

## What Was Happening
- The Judge0 API via RapidAPI has a daily limit on the BASIC plan
- When the quota was exceeded, the API returned an error message
- The frontend wasn't properly displaying this error message
- Users saw "No output" instead of the actual error

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated API Error Handling
- **File**: `pages/api/execute.js`
- **File**: `pages/api/testcases.js`
- **Change**: Added proper error handling for quota limits and API errors
- **Result**: Clear error messages are now displayed to users

### 2. Error Message Improvements
- Quota errors now show: "Daily quota exceeded for code execution. Please upgrade your RapidAPI plan or try again tomorrow."
- Other API errors are properly caught and displayed
- HTTP status codes are correctly set (429 for quota errors)

## Current Status
✅ **FIXED**: Error handling is now working properly
✅ **FIXED**: Users will see clear error messages instead of "No output"
✅ **FIXED**: Both code execution and test case APIs handle errors correctly

## Solutions for Users

### Option 1: Wait for Daily Reset
- The quota resets daily
- Try again tomorrow when the quota refreshes

### Option 2: Upgrade RapidAPI Plan
- Visit: https://rapidapi.com/judge0-official/api/judge0-ce
- Upgrade from BASIC to a higher tier plan
- Get more daily submissions

### Option 3: Use Alternative Code Execution
- Consider implementing a local code execution solution
- Use Docker containers for code execution
- Implement a different code execution service

## Testing the Fix
The APIs now return proper error responses:

```bash
# Test code execution
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/execute \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"code": "print(\"Hello\")", "languageId": 71}'

# Expected response when quota exceeded:
{
  "error": "Daily quota exceeded for code execution. Please upgrade your RapidAPI plan or try again tomorrow.",
  "details": "You have exceeded the DAILY quota for Submissions on your current plan, BASIC..."
}
```

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: Users will now see clear error messages
2. **Short-term**: Consider upgrading the RapidAPI plan
3. **Long-term**: Implement alternative code execution solutions

The code editor will now properly display error messages instead of showing "No output" when there are API issues.
